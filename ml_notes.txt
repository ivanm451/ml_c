Here is what we did for our first machine learning model

We have a data set like this:
0 0 
1 2
2 4
3 6
4 8

Then we build our model: y = x*w, so that it can predict any element of the second value.
In a real world usage, we wouldn't know what the result may be, but in this simple example we do so it helps.

w is our parameter. models can have many. 
x is our input to the model. the first column of values in our data set. 
d is the distance from our output to our actual value in second column of data set.
We use seeding (random number generation) to create random initial guess. 

By introducing cost function we can make our guesses better. 
If we think of our model as a function we can use derivatives to find the minima where d = 0 meaning we guessed correctly. 
But computer is discrete. Well, we can use finite difference approach to implement limit def of derivative. 

We program our cost function as its own function in the code and then we run it in for loop
The output of our cost function can then be used as function for finite difference which gently nudges us to a better guess.
